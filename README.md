# Wooting-Game-Detection

## About this project
This is a project I started to allow people to automatically swap profiles on application run. The start of the code was very juvenile code but with help from Hollow, it was improved to the point it runs 100x better

## How to use
I have worked to make the code as easy for anyone to use, you do not even need to know how to code to add your own games and get going with the current version!

### 1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/copvampire/Wooting-Game-Detection/raw/master/Wooting-Game-Detection.zip)
### 2. Extract files
### 3. Edit the Config.ini to match what games need what profile
### 4. Run the Wooting-Game-Detection.exe as Administrator (To get it to load on startup, put a shortcut into the startup folder)
(p.s it will run as a background process, at the present time it will take a restart of the process to restart the config.ini)



## Requested features and planned features:
A UI where you can assign profile numbers to games, change it on the fly.
